🚀 About Me

I’m a tech and engineering enthusiast who codes in Python, C++, and Arduino IDE, with experience in front-end and back-end web development.
My journey started with Roblox Studio, which sparked my love for creating, coding, and problem-solving.
I’m also passionate about rockets, physics, quantum mechanics, and innovation—dreaming to work with NASA, SpaceX, or Lockheed Martin, and study at MIT someday.
